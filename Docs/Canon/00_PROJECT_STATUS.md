# Project Status

Current Phase: **Phase 11 Complete — Command Bus and Action System**

## Build Status

- **Passing**
- All 20 test suites build and pass
- Tests require online fetch of Catch2 (gated behind `ATLAS_ENABLE_ONLINE_DEPS`)

## Repo Condition

- Structure coherent and consistent
- Naming unified to AtlasAI canon (zero Arbiter remnants in active paths)
- Docs aligned with current canon
- Editor surface rationalized (~10 primary tool implementations)
- Backend strategy formalized (Phase 2 complete)
- Workspace integration surfaces formally contracted (Phase 7)

## Phase Summary

| 3 | Editor Consolidation | ✅ Done |
| 4 | AtlasAI and Codex Integration | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Hosted Project Support | ✅ Done |
| 6 | Build, Patch, and Release Pipeline | ✅ Done |
| 7 | Workspace Integration Surfaces | ✅ Done |
| 8 | Runtime Wiring and First Real Tool Loop | ✅ Done |
| 9 | Asset Pipeline and Content Routing | ✅ Done |
| 10 | Project Persistence and Serialization | ✅ Done |
| 11 | Command Bus and Action System | ✅ Done |

## Active Problems

None critical. Minor open items:
- GDI backend is still the active rendering path; D3D11 targeted but not yet executing
- AtlasAI panel host tests require Editor-heavy deps (covered in Phase4 tests)

## Next Milestone

**Phase 12: Event Bus and Workspace Notifications**

Implement the workspace-level publish/subscribe event infrastructure:
- WorkspaceEvent — typed event descriptor (eventType, source, payload string, timestamp token)
- EventBus — subscribe/unsubscribe/publish; per-type subscriber lists; synchronous dispatch; wildcard subscriptions
- EventQueue — deferred/async event accumulation with tick-based drain; priority ordering
- WorkspaceNotification — higher-level notification model (info/warning/error severity) layered on EventBus
