# Project Status

Current Phase: **Phase 15 Complete — Workspace Diagnostics and Telemetry**

## Build Status

- **Passing**
- All 23 test suites build and pass
- Tests require online fetch of Catch2 (gated behind `ATLAS_ENABLE_ONLINE_DEPS`)

## Repo Condition

- Structure coherent and consistent
- Naming unified to AtlasAI canon (zero Arbiter remnants in active paths)
- Docs aligned with current canon
- Editor surface rationalized (~10 primary tool implementations)
- Backend strategy formalized (Phase 2 complete)
- Workspace integration surfaces formally contracted (Phase 7)
- Workspace-level event bus and notification system operational (Phase 12)

## Active Problems

None critical. Minor open items:
- GDI backend is still the active rendering path; D3D11 targeted but not yet executing
- AtlasAI panel host tests require Editor-heavy deps (covered in Phase4 tests)

## Next Milestone

**Phase 16: Workspace Scripting and Automation**

Implement workspace-level scripting and automation infrastructure:
- ScriptBinding — typed script function binding with parameter descriptors
- ScriptContext — execution environment with variable scope
- ScriptEngine — register/execute script bindings with error handling
- AutomationTask — named automation sequence with step execution
