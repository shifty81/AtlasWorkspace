# Project Status

Current Phase: **Phase 9 Complete — Asset Pipeline and Content Routing**

## Build Status

- **Passing**
- All 20 test suites build and pass
- Tests require online fetch of Catch2 (gated behind `ATLAS_ENABLE_ONLINE_DEPS`)

## Repo Condition

- Structure coherent and consistent
- Naming unified to AtlasAI canon (zero Arbiter remnants in active paths)
- Docs aligned with current canon
- Editor surface rationalized (~10 primary tool implementations)
- Backend strategy formalized (Phase 2 complete)
- Workspace integration surfaces formally contracted (Phase 7)

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Title | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0 | Canon Reset and Consolidation | ✅ Done |
| 1 | Workspace Core Stabilization | ✅ Done |
| 2 | AtlasUI Backend Strategy | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Editor Consolidation | ✅ Done |
| 4 | AtlasAI and Codex Integration | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Hosted Project Support | ✅ Done |
| 6 | Build, Patch, and Release Pipeline | ✅ Done |
| 7 | Workspace Integration Surfaces | ✅ Done |
| 8 | Runtime Wiring and First Real Tool Loop | ✅ Done |
| 9 | Asset Pipeline and Content Routing | ✅ Done |

## Active Problems

None critical. Minor open items:
- GDI backend is still the active rendering path; D3D11 targeted but not yet executing
- AtlasAI panel host tests require Editor-heavy deps (covered in Phase4 tests)

## Next Milestone

**Phase 10: Project Persistence and Serialization**

Formalize the save/load contract for workspace state:
- WorkspaceProjectFile — canonical .atlasproject file format (JSON schema)
- ProjectSerializer — write/read WorkspaceShell state to/from disk
- AssetCatalogSerializer — serialize/deserialize AssetCatalog (add/remove/dirty)
- SettingsStore — typed key-value store for workspace settings with layering (user/project/defaults)
