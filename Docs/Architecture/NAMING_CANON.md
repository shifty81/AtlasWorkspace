# Naming Canon

> Canonical reference: `Docs/Canon/03_NAMING_CANON.md`

This document mirrors the naming canon for Architecture-directory consumers.

## Core Names

| Name | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| AtlasWorkspace | The development host platform executable and repo |
| AtlasUI | The native C++ UI framework (widgets, theme, draw lists) |
| AtlasAI | The AI broker system (formerly Arbiter + SwissAgent) |
| NovaForge | The hosted game project (adapter-loaded, logically detachable) |
| WorkspaceShell | Composition root — owns registries, managers, services |
| IHostedTool | Interface for primary workspace tools |
| IGameProjectAdapter | Interface for project plugin loading |
| ISharedPanel | Interface for reusable workspace panels |

## Retired Names

| Old Name | Replacement | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Arbiter | AtlasAI | ✅ Active-path references migrated; historical preserved in Archive |
| SwissAgent | AtlasAI | ✅ Absorbed into AtlasAIAdapter; SwissAgentAdapter removed |
| EditorApp | WorkspaceShell+WorkspaceRenderer | Legacy dual-runtime path deprecated |
| NF_Editor (standalone) | NF::Workspace + NF::Editor | Split into OS layer and tool layer |

## Namespace Conventions

- `NF::` — root namespace for all workspace modules
- `NF::Workspace` — OS-like host layer (shell, registries, services)
- `NF::Editor` — primary tool implementations
- `NF::UI` — AtlasUI widget and rendering system
- `NovaForge::` — project-specific code (adapter, panels, game systems)
